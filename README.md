# collaborative-filtering-recommendation-system

Recently, Iâ€™ve been really interested in being able to using predictive analytics to better understand user preferences and predict their preferences in the future. 

That is what this project aims to do!

So what is collaborative filtering? Collaborative filtering (CF) is a technique used by recommender systems.

In the newer, narrower sense, collaborative filtering is a method of making automatic predictions (filtering) about the interests of a user by collecting preferences or taste information from many users (collaborating). The underlying assumption of the collaborative filtering approach is that if a person A has the same opinion as a person B on an issue, A is more likely to have B's opinion on a different issue than that of a randomly chosen person.

The data set used was taken from MovieLens. It contains 100,000 ratings from a total of 1000 users on 1700 movies. 




Note: this was one of my first projects in the space so this was a walkthrough through a previous tutorial that I did myself learning how the individual did it!
